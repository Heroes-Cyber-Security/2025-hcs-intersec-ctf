    <h1>Guidance</h1>

    <p>
      The world had never been kind to him.
      Every morning felt like waking to a battlefield he didn’t remember enlisting in. The voices of others—sharp, mocking, indifferent—echoed louder than his own thoughts. Sometimes, he wished he could mute them all, drown the world in silence, and disappear unnoticed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then there was her.
      She didn’t silence the world—she softened it. She didn’t erase the cruelty—she reminded him that it wasn’t all there was. With the gentleness of someone who knew pain too intimately, she extended her hand to him. No grand speeches, no flawless perfection, just a presence that said, “Even if the world rejects you, I won’t.”
    </p>

    <p>
      At first, he couldn’t understand why. Why would someone choose to stand beside someone so broken, so weighed down by mistakes and guilt? But she guided him—not by pulling, not by forcing, but by walking just a step ahead, just close enough that he could see her back and know he wasn’t alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      On days when his chest felt too heavy to breathe, she would smile, fragile yet unwavering.
      On nights when the past clawed its way into his dreams, she would listen, not to fix him, but to remind him that his story wasn’t over.
    </p>

    <p>
      And slowly, the battlefield quieted. The voices, though still cruel, lost their power. Because he had learned to listen to hers instead—the voice that told him he was worthy of trying again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Guidance, he realized, wasn’t about someone dragging you out of the darkness. It was about someone staying long enough for you to find the strength to step forward on your own.
      And in that cruel world, her love became not an escape, but a compass. One that pointed not away from pain, but toward the courage to live through it.
