# Proof of Concept

## TL;DR

- The challenge exposes a custom static file handler in Go.
- It concatenates `"." + rawPath` without proper sanitization.
- When using the uncommon HTTP method **CONNECT** together with `--path-as-is`, Go’s standard library does not normalize `../`.
- This allows a **path traversal** outside the `public/` directory.
- The flag is located at `/flag.txt`.

## Steps

1. Send a request with the `CONNECT` method and `--path-as-is` option to bypass Go’s path cleaning:

   ```bash
   curl -X CONNECT --path-as-is "http://localhost:8080/../../flag.txt"
    ```
