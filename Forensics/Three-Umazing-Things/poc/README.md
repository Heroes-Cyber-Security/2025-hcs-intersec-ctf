# Proof of Concept

## TL;DR

Three tools that can be used to solve this challenge is Binwalk, Stegseek and Zsteg

Binwalk -> `hehe.jpg` -> get part 3 of the flag

Stegseek -> `grrrr.jpg` -> get part 2 of the flag

> for stegseek, you can use rockyou.txt for the wordlist

Zsteg -> `sedihakuwak.png` -> get part 1 of the flag
